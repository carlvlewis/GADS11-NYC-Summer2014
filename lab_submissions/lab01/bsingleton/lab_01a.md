Ben Singleton, Intelligence Analyst / Crime Strategist 

I currently work at the Manhattan DA's Office, but I'm starting at NYPD in a week.

First programmed in Palm OS many a years ago. Left programming for a while but returned somewhat recently to teach myself VBA because there was stuff I wanted to do at work that I couldn't do otherwise - I've since taken classes in Ruby / HTML / CSS at GA and am working on beefing up my Python skills. I'm a grad student studying Criminal Justice so stats is pretty fresh for me.
