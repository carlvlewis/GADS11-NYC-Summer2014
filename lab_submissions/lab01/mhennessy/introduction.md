Systems Administrator

Coding and Math Background
==========================
I have written code to glue bits and pieces together for a long time.
I use mostly Perl and bash for this.
I have a degree in CS with a minor in psychology.  I do have some math
from that coursework, but I'm more than a bit rusty.

Social Networking
=================
What's that? ;)

Data Blog Post?
===============
I discovered the subreddit called "Data is Beautiful" (yes, *is* is technically wrong)
